</div> Georgios Rizos graduated in 2012 from the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. He continued with postgraduate studies at the Imperial College of London, where he acquired his M.Sc. with distinction in Biomedical Engineering in 2013.

Between 2013 and 2017 he worked at the Information Technologies Institute of the Centre for Research and Technology Hellas as a research assistant, applying machine learning techniques on large scale data from social networks in the context of the FP7-REVEAL and H2020-STEP projects. This work has led to the publication (among others) of a PLOS One article on multilabel online user classification using localized community detection.

Georgios is currently carrying out his PhD in Reinforcement Learning via Bayesian Neural Networks under the supervision of Dr. Bj√∂rn Schuller as a member of the HiPEDS Centre for Doctoral Training 2017 cohort. His PhD work is funded by the prestigious President's Scholarship of Imperial College London. /.blurb
